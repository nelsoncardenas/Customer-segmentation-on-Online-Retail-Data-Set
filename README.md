# Customer-segmentation-on-Online-Retail-Data-Set
Customer segmentation (or market segmentation) are techniques to split customers into clusters based on similarities to get a sense of their behavior. In this notebook, we are going to analyze patterns in the Online Retail Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You will find K-means and RFM model to segment
