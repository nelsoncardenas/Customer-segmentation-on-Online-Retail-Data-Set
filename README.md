Customer segmentation (or market segmentation) are techniques to split customers into clusters based on similarities to get a sense of their behavior. In this notebook, we are going to analyze patterns in the Online Retail Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A k-means model is used based on the RFM measures.
